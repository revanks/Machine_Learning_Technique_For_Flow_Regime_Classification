### Two Phase Regime Classification in a Straight Horizontal Pipe

## About the project
- In the present study the 7 different two-phase flow regimes classified for refrigerant flow occurring in a horizontal straight pipe during adiabatic wall conditions are made with the application of Random Forest Classifier (RFC), and Xtreme Gradient Boosting Classifier (XGBC)

## Methods
- More than 390+ experimental two-phase pressure drop data is taken from the literature with features- mass flux, vapor quality, pipe diameter, saturation pressure and saturation temperature

- RFC and XGBC models trained with 22 input features to classify 7 different flow regimes

## Conclusion
- It is concluded that the application of RFC is shown best results in classifying flow regimes
